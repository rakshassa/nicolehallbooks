TODO: How do we simulate a fight with only 1 roster.  Each registered person needs to be able to create multiple Rosters
  -- everyone can create 2 rosters (limited to one version of each character)
  -- pay to have additional 2 rosters - multiple purchases allowed
  -- patreon link to monitize
  -- import teams from every node in every campaign/scenario/challenge
    -- simulate battles against them (pay)
  -- create a discord to discuss the website, make suggestions, etc
  -- consider "ads" to monitize

1.2. Home Page should be more attractive (advertisement for self)
  -- Blurb about what we are doing with "Get Started" button to register/login.
  -- Vertical scroll to colored sections: Browse Every Character, Create a Roster, Simulate Battles
    -- collage/images in each section from the actual website.
1.3 Character List
  -- search by char name or trait (partial matching, instant filtering)
    -- see msf.gg for filters
    -- or use search/filter/sort options like "in-game"
  -- layout improvement
    -- see "in-game" layout of roster
2. omniauth through discord/google/facebook to have a custom player to store roster
  -- google and facebook omni needs app config
3. show roster (or force login)
  -- switch to a new roster
    -- everyone starts with one main roster
    -- clone existing (same stats as selected one)
    -- create new (nothing unlocked)
    -- delete roster (do not allow delete of main one)
    -- player has a "max_rosters" setting based on how many times they have paid to unlock more (default: 2)
  -- character list with color change for not-unlocked
    -- select toon, set level/stars/gear/etc
    -- calculate total stats (health, damage, etc)
  -- mark favorites (to stay on top)
  -- search/filter/sort options like "in-game"
4. create/edit squad
  -- select 5 toons from roster, give positions
    -- search/filter/sort options like "in-game"
5. select 2 squads to fight each other
  -- run pre-battle passives
  -- determine initiate
  -- cycle initiative and proc before/during/after skills

=======================
ROSTER (database)
=======================

player
  - name
  - stark_tech (1-25% for simplicity)

unlocked_character
  - player_id (foreign)
  - character_id (foreign)

  - level
  - gear_tier (ignoring individual gear)
  - yellow_stars
  - red_stars
  - basic_rank
  - special_rank
  - ultimate_rank
  - passive_rank

Squads (1-5 records per squad - no duplicate positions or characters)
  - player_id
  - squad_id
  - unlocked_character_id
  - position

=======================
Calculated Stats (state based)
=======================
stats
  - health
  - damage
  - armor
  - focus
  - resistance
  - crit_damage
  - crit_chance
  - speed
  - dodge_chance
  - block_chance
  - block_amount
  - accuracy

NOTE: calculation is:

total = base_adjusted_for_level + yellow_star + red_star + gear + stark_tech + passive_ability_mods


=======================
Effects (database)
=======================
effect (see msf.gg/effects)
  - name
  - description
  - expiration
  - opposite_effect_id

=======================
Battle (state based)
=======================
battle
  - team_1
  - team_2

team
  - player_id
  - battle_characters

battle_character
  - unlocked_character_id
  - position
  - battle_effects
  - is_alive
  - stats
  - special_ability_energy
  - ultimate_ability_energy
  - has_revived
  - is_clone
  - is_summon
  - speed_bar (0-1000) - so 50% speed bar is 500 speed_bar.
    -- each tick, gain your speed value toward speed bar.
    -- speed bar can add infinitely - each turn taken reduces by 1000
    -- ??? how do we move forward on "ticks" - calculate which toon is fewest ticks from 1k, and increment by that much tick.

======================
Battle-Setup (state based)
======================

Select Players (2)
For each player:
  Select Squads and position characters
For each toon:
  Calculate Synergies
  Calculate starting stats
  Calculate starting ability energy
  Execute Passives (on-battle-begins)

======================
Battle-Turns (processing)
======================

Select next toon:
  If any toon.speed_bar > 1000:
    select all toons with highest speed_bar:
      on tie: random select from highest speed_bar toons
      else: select highest speed_bar toon
  Else:
    calculate how many ticks (fractional) until 1000 speed_bar for each toon.
    select toon with lowest fractional_ticks_remaining AND increment all speed_bars by that many ticks. (on tie, random select one)

Select Target:
  if any enemy has taunt, random select one.
  else: if any enemy has no stealth, random select one.
  else: random select any enemy

Select ability:
  if stunned: skip turn
  if ability blocked: use basic

  if ultimate has enough energy: use ultimate
  else if special has enough energy: use special
  else use basic

Process outcomes
  consider AOE, hit all, hit adjacent, and chains
  calculate damage/kills
  add/remove effects
  assists


============================
Effects (processing)
============================
on-turn-start (bleed/regen)
on-turn-end (remove ending effects)
on-friendly-turn-start
on-friendly-turn-end (assist)
on-enemy-turn-start
on-enemy-turn-end (counter)
on-kill (black-panther speed_bar)
on-death (ultron revive)
on-any-death (mordo heal)

toon.process_ability(ability_id, target)
toon.process_assist(target)
toon.process_counter(target)
